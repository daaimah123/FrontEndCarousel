Bootstrap
============
This uses HTML and Bootstrap.

Placing an active to first data-target so that it remains the first to see when loading the page; data-slide-to will load the dots/lines that are at the bottom of slider some navigation with the number of instances you've provided (0-2 will give 3 instances)

Add class of "img-responsive" to your images so that they are responsive to all screen sizes.

Adding right and left to carousel-control will give your navigation some fade effect; don't forget your carousel-caption for photo captions.

JavaScript
==============
This uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript.



Reflection
==============
Stuck on getting the images from a vertical stack for JS problem, unable to solve within time given. Somehow fixed with bootstrap in first problem. Like the built in effects bootstrap has for this feature.
